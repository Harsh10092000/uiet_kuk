                    The Department of Computer Science & Engineering was
                    established in the year 2004. The Department started with an
                    intake of 60 in B. Tech. degree programme & 20 in M. Tech.
                    (Software Engineering). In view of the increasing importance
                    of the Computer Engineering discipline, the intake of the
                    department was increased to 120 in 2007. The department is
                    proud to have a record of almost 100% placement of all
                    eligible students for last 05 years. The new B.Tech Course
                    Computer Science & Engineering (Artificial Intelligence &
                    Machine Learning) has also started from the year 2023-24
                    with the intake of 60 students.
                  </p>
